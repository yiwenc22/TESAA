        <h2>My Contributions to the Project</h2>
        <p>As one of the developer of this project, I played a pivotal role in bringing the Oceanic Institute of Hawaii VR Experience to life. My responsibilities and accomplishments include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>On-Site Video Recording: I personally visited the Oceanic Institute of Hawaii and captured the 360-degree video footage using the Insta360 Pro 2 camera. This involved careful planning and execution to ensure that the final product would be as immersive and realistic as possible.</li>
          <li>Video Processing: After capturing the footage, I processed the videos using the Insta360 Stitcher software to create seamless, high-quality 360-degree videos suitable for the VR experience.</li>
          <li>Importing Videos into Unity: I imported the processed videos into the Unity platform and integrated them with the 3D environments, ensuring smooth transitions and a cohesive overall experience.</li>
          <li>Scripting: I wrote custom C# scripts to manage the tracking of scene information and transition data. These scripts facilitate seamless navigation through the experience and enable user interactions with the 3D environment.</li>
        </ul>
