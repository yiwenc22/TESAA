        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>ReportSight is a application created for the Hawaii Annual Code Challenge(HACC) to help Hawaii Marine Animal Response(HMAR). The application allow
          HMAR workers to maintain report forms with more accurate reporting location and information. The application also allow reporter
          to summit forms for sighting of a marine animals with users friendly interface. The application was build using meteor, react, and bootstraps to give user a smooth and nice looks
        for the UI.</p>

        <h2>What I learned from the experience</h2>
        <p>From the experience, I learned how to design the application under a direct requirement. The HMAR have created a list of functionality they would like to see on the application, so our team
          have to divide the works evenly to successfully implement all the requirement to the application. With that I was able to learn about team work and time management since it is a time killer to puzzle the pieces all together
          and keep questioning to advance the final product. In addition, our team learn how to work with Google Map API and CVS files. Which were the thing we had never experienced before.</p>

        <h2>What I contributed to the project and problem I encounter</h2>
        <p>In this project, I mainly work on the front end and the Google API functionality for the project. I Created a Map for the admin page to display form with marker using the google APIs. Allowing the forms
        to show up after clicking on the markers. I also implement the GEOCODE for the forms submit to detect where the user is when reporting the sighting. At last, I use bootstrap to polish the site to look more clean
        and user friendly.</p>
