        ManoaMusicBubs
      </h1>
      <p> This was the final project for the class ICS 314<p>
      <br><br>
        <p>
        Manoa-musicbuds is an example web application where many UH students with great musical talents find others with similar tastes and compatible musical abilities. It will allow students to login and create a profile indicating their musical tastes, their musical capabilities, and their musical goals (from occasional, informal jam sessions to performing bands). The profile can also include links to YouTube videos or SoundCloud tracks with examples of their musicianship.
      </p>
<br>
        <p>My role in this project is the programmer and responsible for the profile page, sign up, in a page, and data base info. I have to develop a page for the user
        to change their info after account sign up. I came up with the default data base for the site, and keep data and form of the users email and password.<p>
          <br>
        <p>
        I Learned that Working with someone is always better than by yourself, we helped each other when one of us does not understand.
        The funniest part and learn the most was debugging, of course, the site does not always function as planed but with time and teamwork,
        we were able to correct all the mistakes. Learn how to make site look better and function better.
