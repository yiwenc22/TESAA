        <h2>What is the app and What is for</h2>
        <p>Covid-Tracker is a self screening platform that makes it easy for individuals to provide a daily self check in
          of their health status before leaving their home, entering a work environment, or going to a campus. The Main function of the site include allowing user to check in
        for covid symptoms, allow user to see past history of check ins, and allow users to upload/edit vaccine card information. The main purpose of building this site is for refreshing
        the skills and the knowledge use for meteor to prepare for the meteor Hackathon </p>

        <h2>What I learned from the experience</h2>
        <p>Building this project helps me refresh on the memory working with meteor and semanticUI. Since it being a while, I learned how to deploy the project online by looking up
        for steps to do it. This project also improve my knowledge on how to upload and display picture in reacts, since when I try doing the html way it did not work. </p>
        <br>
        <p>Since this is not a personal project, I learn about how to work as a team to solve problem and using the google project board to assign which task/ticket each should do. I also learn
        new way to solve some problem and view a problem since we are working in team, we can help other around and share idea.</p>

        <h2>What I contributed to the project and problem I encounter</h2>
        <p>In this project, I mainly work on the front end. I work on the landing page, home page, and profile page. On the landing page, I work on where everything should go and make it simple.
        For the home page, I work on the Nav bar and CSS for some of the text and icon. And for the profile page, I worked with the team to let users upload vaccine card and display it. Some of the problem
        our team encounter was trying to find the way to display the image after upload and using other way to get username other than meteor.</p>
