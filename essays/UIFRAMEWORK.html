        <h2>What is UI Frameworks?</h2>
      <p>The proper definition of UI Frameworks is "the set of classes and interfaces that define the elements and behavior of a window-based UI subsystem." In short, UI Frameworks is the makeup (example: lipstick, etc.) for the website. UI Frameworks helps create a stylized and professional-looking web application with less work. </p>
        <br>
          <h2>Purl HTML VS UI Frameworks</h2>
          <p>Before UI frameworks, most UI styles were built with pure HTML and CSS, and UI frameworks are not simple too (it is like learning a new language), so why do people still create and learn it? The main reason is that UI Frameworks is easier to use and better-looking format than pure HTML with CSS. Using UI Frameworks can recreate a site that builds with pure HTML and CSS with less code and work, but pure HTML with CSS can not always recreate a site built with UI framework. On the picture below, one is built with pure HTML(left side), and one is built with the newer and more popular VUE (right side). It should be obvious the form built with Vue looks smoother/nice; also it could take us less work to create too. So, learning UI frameworks is not a waste of time but saves time and helps make more cooler UI.</p>

          <h2>Semantic UI or Bootstrap</h2>
          <p>Semantic UI and Bootstrap are the most common UI frameworks I have experience with. SemanticUI is more straightforward to use and understand, and Bootsrap has more customization and style. After building sites with SemanticUI and Bootstrap, Bootstrap came out as a winner for me. Even though Bootstrap can be harder to understand since it is not straightforward like Semantic, it works with more packages or styles than SemanticUI. For example, 100% of the format works with Bootstrap when using auto Forms, but only 30% of the layout work with semantics.</p>
        <br>
        <p>So, Bootstrap forever?
          The short answer is No since there are many more UI frameworks now, and it could be easier to use and look nicer than Bootstrap. For example, I always want to try VUE JS since it is like the newer and most popular JS/UI. Also, as time passes, many more UI frameworks will be created or updated since UI Framework is like makeup/clothes for a website. And makeups and clothes always have new styles to match the generation's taste (Just like UI Framework). </p>
