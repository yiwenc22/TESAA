        Feeling After Learning about Software Engineering II
      </h1>
        <img src="images/sefeel.jpg">
        <h2>Software Engineering II</h2>
      <p>Different from other class I have taken, this class does not teach but start with
        a project that take the whole semester. Students in the class is separated into 4 teams of 8 - 9 people.
        Personally think this way of learning is better than other class that have homework, quiz, and others.
        Give people a feel of the real life.</p>
          <h2>Opportunity to work with HEI</h2>
          <p>The class give us opportunity to work with a real company called HEI, give us the
            chance to learn and improve our skills in software Engineering. HEI give the class what they want for a site,
            and the four team will try to meet the goals. The project bring in how the field could be like giving us
            milestone with due date. So, we know when to get this working like a real life company would have. </p>
          <img src="/images/git.png">
          <h2>The Starts</h2>
          <p>Everything starts with introduction to the team. Get to know the team than we talk about a mockup of
            the pages. I was assign the feedback, and the about page. The feedback page is for user to feedback when
            encounter an error or need help and about page is just info about the company. Each milestone the whole team
            make goals that we want by the milestone and if one can not make it we all could help, or it passes down to
            the next milestone.</p>
          <h2>Teamwork</h2>
          <p>The project was not a solo work is a teamwork. The most important part in this class is how to time management
            and work as a team. Our team have 1 to 2 meeting each week to talk about the project so everyone can be up to date on it.
            We use github project board to organize of workflow. So, everyone got ticket and tasks to do. With the help of the meeting
            and github project, the team, and I learn a lot about time management. Since each milestone got a due date, and some task
            depends on of the completion of others, So the meeting helps us solve this problem.</p>
