        Feeling After Learning about Software Engineering
      </h1>
        <h2>Software Engineering II</h2>
        <p>Before taking the class of software Engineering, I thought the class was just going talk about developing a website.
          However, I was wrong, Software Engineering is not just about developing a website, it teaches about coding standard,
          the right or wrong how site work, and frames work that help and why it helps. Things I learned from this class,
          can use for other coding project like making games and etc.</p>

          <h2>Rule for Programing Language</h2>
          <p>Every programming language have it own coding standard. Coding standard is like the textbook way of doing the code.
            In the class, I have learned about ESlint and now when I am trying to practice on Java, I will look online for
            coding standard for Java too. I find check style is the coding standard for Java. With coding Standard,
            coding is more clear and more understandable by others.</p>

          <h2>Framework to make life easier</h2>
          <p>Software Engineering not only tell me to just create a website with pure HTML. Which can look very dull and not
            interesting. However, the class teach me about a UI framework called react and semantic UI. With UI framework
            I could save up a lot of time from doing my own css for the same result. Now my site look much better than just pure HTML.</p>
          <h2>Right and wrong for software Engineering</h2>
          <p>Before learning about software engineering, I never think about the ethics of coding. It codes a skill to
            just earn money or to help other that cannot? Ethic in Software Engineering teach me that site should be made
            for a useful thing and not mainly for the money or to scam others. I found my own ethics in software Engineering
            and will chose to follow it. Site to help not to scam.</p>
