        <h2>How to ask a question the smart way?</h2>
      <p>After reading <a href="http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html" class="link link--icon" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">"How To Ask Questions The Smart Way" by Eric Steven and Rick Moen</a>,
        here is what I learned. First, before asking the question,
        make sure the question is not already answered somewhere online, so it does waste people's time answering it again. Make sure to post the
        question on the forum with the same topic. For example, when asking for a coding problem, use StackOverflow, not Yelp. Finally, when writing
        the actual question, make sure it has clear grammar and correct spelling, describe the issue clearly with a goal, make sure the information
        given is valuable and explicit about the question. Also, learn from the mistake; if people ask for more information or no one answers the question,
        then the question is not asked smartly.</p>
        <br>
          <h2>Benefit of asking the question smartly</h2>
          <p>People may ask, "Does asking the questions smartly guarantee an answer?" The answer to that is no, but it will surely increase the chance of being answered correctly.
            Let's talk about the bad when not asking the questions smartly; this will lead to a longer wait since people don't want to waste time understanding the issue or keep
            asking until the information is enough to answer the question. The worst case is the answer is wrong due to misleading information. So, the main benefit of asking the
            question smartly is a higher chance of getting the correct answer, faster response, and more replies. For example, when asking questions on Stackoverflow, there is a
            vote that allows people to upvote or downvote so more people can see it, or no one can see it. So, by asking questions smartly, you will get more upvotes, get the answer
            faster, and have more selection of solutions. </p>

          <h2>Activity : Finding Questions ask in smart way Vs. not smart way on Stackoverflow</h2>
          <p>I try finding question ask in a smart way and question that is not on Stackoverflow. In the process, finding questions
            asked in a smart way was better simple since it will have many upvotes and answers. However, when trying to find the question,
            ask not in a smart way was much harder, since the filter does not work with downvotes. To be fair, both question I found was asked
            around the same time. Lets start by talking about the question asked smartly. The question asked was
            <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70857476/unable-to-load-class-androidcomponentsextension-after-upgrading-the-android-grad" class="link link--icon" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">"Unable to load class AndroidComponentsExtension
              after upgrading the Android Gradle Plugin 7.1"</a> the person provided very detailed information with what the version the it has and what he recently
            downloaded. The question also provides two code blocks with a description of what led to the printing, and it was a tag with all the related topics,
            for example, the android-Gradle-plugin. So, the result of this question was asked two days ago, and it was upvoted 43 times, viewed a thousand times,
            and the author found the answer.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Now, let's look at the question that is not ask smartly, the question ask <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70834436/what-is-the-difference-between-state-and-const" class="link link--icon" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">"What is the difference between `state` and `const`?"</a>
          just from the question there is a big probelm. I search online and found answer to this question right away, so this was a waste of time asking
          it on Stackoverflow. Also, the question did not provide detail, just code block with a word or sentence not explaining what the goal is and what it is doing.
          So, this question's result was that the question was asked three days ago and only viewed 96 times with two downvotes. </p>
        <br>
        <p>As a result of this activity, asking questions smartly increase the rate of being the answer and the speed of being the answer. Even though both questions
          were answered around the same time after being posted. The question asked smartly got many more solutions that the asker could choose from.</p>
