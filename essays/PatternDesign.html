        Is Design Pattern Important?
      </h2>
        <br>
        <h2>You are using design patterns and don't even know it</h2>
      <p>After a few years of working with Web development, I have used design patterns. When I first heard about design patterns and searched them online. I thought I would not use any design patterns at the beginning of development since I was doing basic coding. However, I was using the MVC (The Model View Controller) the whole time since I used a template, and the template uses those design patterns to make the web work as it is.</p>
        <br>
          <h2>Using model view controller design pattern in web development</h2>
          <p>The name almost says it all; the model view controller is a design pattern that specifies that an application should consist of a data model, presentation information, and control information. MVP can also be broken down into three types: MVC, MVP, and MVVM. MVC is a model where a controller does the view and model, while MVP and MVVM don't use the controller to do the same thing.
          </p>

          <h2>Framework Vs Design Pattern</h2>
          <p>Many people mix up a framework and design patterns since both of them is to solve coding problems by providing support. For example, a design pattern is like the concept or equation you need to get to an answer while the framework is ready to use code. In my own words, I think design patterns are like a cheat sheet while the framework is like the answer sheet.
            Typically, most web developers will use the framework and design patterns to solve the problem and make their site work. </p>
        <br>
        <h2>So, what is a Design pattern, and is it essential?</h2>
        <p>The brief definition that can be found online for design pattern shows that design pattern in software engineering is a reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem. In my words, I will say if you find a design you want to do and are not sure how to make it work, try looking at the design patterns. Then, you will know what design patterns are and the important of it.</p>
