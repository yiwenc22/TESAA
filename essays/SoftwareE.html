        Why I want to become a Software engineer?

        <h2>How did it all start?</h2>
      <p>My first time interacting with the software engineer subject was in College;
        When I took ICS 314, which taught the basics of Software engineering, it showed me the magic of how using HTML,
        CSS, and Javascript could create an excellent functional website.
        I always wanted to create a site or application on the phone when I was in high school;
        this was also why I am majoring in Computer Science now. </p>
        <br>
          <h2>Interest, Wages, Amount of choice, or?</h2>
          <p>There are many reasons why I am interested in becoming a software engineer, and here are some reasons. The first and most important reason
            is that I like making sites that look cool and love learning new stuff. The second reason is how many choices are out there since there is
            a site for almost anything. For example, suppose you like cars, food, games, etc. Then, there is a site for it. Finally, you can work in the
            field that most comfort you.  </p>
        <br>
        <p>Other reasons are wages and demand. When I first knew about the field, I heard there was very high demand since practically every industry needs
          someone to build software for them. Also, the salary is good, with an average of $107,948 per year in the United States. However, this position
          has become more challenging and competitive as the year passes. In addition, due to the pandemic, many jobs were open for remote, and many people
          started learning software engineering online at home, making this field less in demand than before.</p>

          <h2>How to make myself stand out?</h2>
          <p>As becoming a software engineer is not easy, I want to improve my skill in the field more. So now, I will be taking classes to improve my
            software engineer skills and applying for a job to get experience. In addition, I plan to learn VueJS in the future since I like the simple
            design that VueJs can create. I will keep practicing and learning about debugging since that is my weakness.
